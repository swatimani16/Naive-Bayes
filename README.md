# Naive-Bayes
Using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, ROC, AUC plotting. 
I have implemented the codes using python version 3.7 on Spyder. 
I have used the libraries numpy,pandas,scipy.stats,matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs,dataframes and other encoding. 
No predefined functions have been used for finding the ROC,AUC or calculating predictions,posteriors, errros,confusion matrix. 
Mean,standard deviation,guassian pdf have been calculated using inbuilt functions. 

Code Running instructions: 
 
Run the file Name: myNB.py  
The generation of Data will take place and the Naive Bayes function after being implemented, the function will return the predicted values,posterior and the error values after calculation

The scatterplot of the labelled data points is plotted. 
The accurracy,precision,recall and confusion matrix is calculated and printed on the console and has been shown in the report. 

Different data points been given which have to be passed, thus corresponding to each datapoint the accuracy is calculated and a plot of datapoints versus accuracy is plotted. 

The prediction using 700 points for class 0 and 300 for class 1 is calculated and the accuracy is noted.The observation has been shown in the report. 

 RoC and AUC has been asked to be plotted in the part 1 and part 4 of the question, thus they have been implemented and we have obtained the plot as shown in the report.
